          <p>
          Welcome to Anand Jyoti Foundation, an NGO dedicated to uplifting the marginalized and disadvantaged communities in the rural areas of Maharashtra, particularly in Melghat Tribal Area. We are a group of passionate individuals committed to making a difference in the areas of livelihood, health, and education.

Since our informal beginnings in 2018, we have collaborated with various schools and community partners to uplift and empower the local tribal communities. In January 2023, we officially registered as an NGO to further our mission and expand our impact.
