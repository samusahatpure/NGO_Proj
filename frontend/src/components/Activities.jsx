            Date - 6th of Dec 2023 (Death Anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar)
            Activity - Founded Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Abhyasika (Study Room)
            Place - Takarkheda More, Taluka Anjangaon Surji, District Amravati (MH)<br></br>
            Purpose - Takarkheda More is a village in Amravati district of Maharashtra. Boys and Girls have to travel 5km in order to attend classes and study room. Study Rooms here in nearby city i.e. Anjangaon Surji costs Rs. 800 to Rs. 1000/- per month. Only those persons who can afford these fees attend the Study Room. Mostly girls from Takarkheda More village avoid going to Anjangaon Surji as it is hectic journey and consumes too much of time.<br></br>

            So, Anand Jyoti Foundation has taken initiative and started this Abhyasika (Study Room) in the village. It is free of cost for all. The Tables and Chairs are arranged there and the place has washroom facility also. This platform (i.e Abhyasika) is beneficial for many, especially teenage girls who are studying in 11th and 12th and avoids going to the city to study.
